# Webscraper

In this project Im going to make a webscraper that will scrape a job board periodically and then send each job to a database.

## Database

I will be using postgreSQL as the database of choice. This will be using the [`SQLAlchemy`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) library. Using the `sql_wrapper` class, I will be able to execute queries directly to the database.

[`publicly accessable postgreSQL database`](https://rnacentral.org/help/public-database) for testing.
